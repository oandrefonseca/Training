## Why should I use it?

There are plenty of reasons to use Google Colab. In summary, it is a collaborative environment (Colab stands for Collaboratory :eyes:) to code and share workflows among users. It lets you and your team members edit documents the way you work with Google Docs. Additionally, Google Colab provides a good computational environment, allowing statistical analysis or even machine learning processes. In fact, there are a few ways to go up to 25Gb memory and use free GPU processors! :scream:

#### Plus, Colab is free to use!  :heart_eyes:

Congrats! If you can see the screenshot below, it means that you made it through the whole setup process! We are at the very end! **However, there is a final step required.** :blush:

Hold on! To avoid any potential conflicts among users, each student should have an individual notebook. To do so, we can follow the first lines on the "APE-Gen_minimal_example" file. In short, that will create a private copy in your Google Drive.
